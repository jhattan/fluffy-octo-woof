#Crossing the Plains

Two sullen bullocks *led the line*,

Their great eyes shining bright like wine;

Two sullen captive kings were they,

That had in time held herds at bay,

And even now they crushed the sod

With stolid **sense of majesty**,

And stately *stepped* and stately *trod*,

As if â€˜t were something still to be

**Kings even in captivity**.
